1.HDFS
      It stands for HaDoop File System.
      It is based on GFS(Google File System) which is a master-slave design where master is a single namenode and slave can be any number of datanodes.
      HDFS is used to store very large amounts of data in a contiguous manner where as traditional file systems do not store it in this way.
      COMPONENTS OF HDFS:
            NAME NODE:It stores the metadata i.e., information regarding the data present in datanodes.
            SECONDRY NAME NODE:It helps in merging fsimage and edit logs and then give fresh updates to the namenode regarding metadata of datanode.
            DATA NODE:  It contains the actual data that is to be stored.
              
2)Hadoop Cluster:
     * A Hadoop cluster is a special type of 
        computational cluster(set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that they are treated as a single machine)  
        designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.
     *A large number of nodes are connected with each other, whose details are stored in a namenode.
     *Whenever some data is to be stored, namenode gives the details of free space in the datanodes in which new data can be stored.
     *Likewise,namenode also gives the details of information present in the datanodes in the cluster that is to be retrieved.



3)HDFS Blocks:
     *A file that is to be stored in HDFS is divided into several blocks, each of 128MB by default.
     *These blocks are arranged in a continuous manner inorder to
              Reduce disk seek time so that data can be read in less rotations of hard disk.
     *Where as in local file system, data is not stored in continuous manner.This leads to increase in seek time which inturn reduces the efficiency.
     *Storage of HDFS blocks in a continuous manner improves efficiency by reducing the data retrieval time.
